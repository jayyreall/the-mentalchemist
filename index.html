          <div class="panel-text-two-column">
            <p>The Mentalchemist is a living ecosystem devoted to reclaiming healing as accessible, embodied transformation. 
It’s not about fixing what’s "broken", it’s about remembering what’s whole. Mentalchemy is the art and science of transforming awareness into embodied change.
It bridges evidence-based psychology, somatic practice, and creative expression to guide people back to the one place true control exists: within themselves.</p>
            <p>Our mission is to make healing practical, inclusive, and rooted in lived experience. 
Our vision is a world where emotional literacy, body awareness, and liberation are considered essential skills and abilities, not luxuries.
We honor values of liberation, embodiment, autonomy, transformation, truth, accessibility, decolonization, creativity, compassion, and integrity; not as hierarchy, but as a living web of what it means to be fully human.
When you engage with The Mentalchemist, you’re not entering a program. You’re joining a movement that believes healing is a right, not a privilege.</p>

          <h2>Meet the Founder</h2>
          <p>Tori is a somatic practitioner, musical artist, and mental health professional bridging science and spirit to make healing feel human again.

With a background in psychology, social work, and public health, as well as lived experience as a CPTSD survivor, Tori approaches healing as both personal practice and collective responsibility. 

Her work merges clinical skill, creative process, and intuitive embodiment to help people reconnect to their agency and design lives that feel like their own.

She created The Mentalchemist as a container for truth, autonomy, and transformation. It is a place where evidence-based care meets ancestral wisdom. Where every emotion holds intelligence.

Tori is a firm believer that "there are no coincidences.”

Follow her work through coaching, digital tools, immersive events, and community collaborations. Or simply begin with one grounding breath.
Your body already knows the way back.</p>
